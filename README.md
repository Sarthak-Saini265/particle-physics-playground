## Summary

Create an interactive Particle Physics Playground! A beautiful, fun web app where users can:

1. Click anywhere on the screen to create explosive particle effects with random colors
2. Particles should have realistic physics - gravity, velocity, fade out over time
3. Include control sliders for:
   - Gravity strength (0-2)
   - Particle count per explosion (10-200)
   - Particle lifetime (1-5 seconds)
   - Particle size (2-20 pixels)
4. Add preset effect buttons:
   - üéÜ Fireworks (colorful, upward burst)
   - ‚≠ê Stars (golden, twinkling effect)
   - üí´ Galaxy (spiral pattern, purple/blue)
   - üåà Rainbow (all colors, gentle cascade)
   - ‚ùÑÔ∏è Snow (white/blue, slow falling)
5. Include a 'Clear Canvas' button
6. Show FPS counter in top-right corner
7. Add a dark gradient background (deep blue to black)
8. Display particle count on screen
9. Include keyboard shortcuts:
   - Space: Random explosion at center
   - C: Clear canvas
   - 1-5: Activate preset effects
10. Add smooth animations using requestAnimationFrame
11. Make it visually stunning with glow effects and smooth transitions

The app should feel magical and satisfying to interact with - like playing with digital fireworks!
